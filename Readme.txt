# To run this file

1. You should have installed Python or py, pypy installed globally
(I was using pypy)

2. Type in the cmd with the current path and use it according to your python globally PATH $.

for example: dir/pypy pks.py
	     dir/python pks.py
 	     dir/py pks.py

3. If it doesn't work, you should have Python in the PATH on your pc.

4. Just follow what the program is asking you, is very intuitive.


##If you want to see the script LUA use the ports, 10 and 20, unfortunately I didn't solve it in order to be able to recognise every port.

###IMPORTANT: BE SURE YOU PUT CORRECT VALUES IN SRC PORT AND DST PORT, in the other node MUST be the opposite.

#BUGS
I apologize, but there is one bug when you save the file name, the first input that you put in the "save file with name" will send a message. If you type another, you will save the file with that name, I know it could be a little bit strange but I didn't have the time to fixed it or well find it... 

During class, I can show you a version of the project without the bug.
